                <p>his happened, indeed, to the train in which Mr. Fogg was travelling. About twelve o'clock
                    a troop of ten
                    or twelve thousand head of buffalo encumbered the track. The locomotive, slackening its speed,
                    tried
                    to
                    clear the way with its cow–catcher; but the mass of animals was too great. The buffaloes marched
                    along
                    with a tranquil gait, uttering now and then deafening
                    bellowings. There was no use of interrupting them, for, having taken a particular direction,
                    nothing
                    can
                    moderate and change their course; it is a torrent of living flesh which no dam could contain.
                </p>

                <p>The travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the platforms; but Phileas Fogg, who had the
                    most
                    reason of all to be in a hurry, remained in his seat, and waited philosophically until it should
                    please
                    the buffaloes to get out of the way.
                    Passepartout was furious at the delay they occasioned, and longed to discharge his arsenal of
                    revolvers
                    upon them.</p>

                <p>"What a country!" cried he. "Mere cattle stop the trains, and go by in a procession, just as if
                    they
                    were not impeding travel! Parbleu! I should like to know if Mr. Fogg foresaw this mishap in his
                    programme! And here's an engineer who doesn't dare to run the locomotive into this herd of
                    beasts!"
                </p>
                <i class="engineer"> <span>“ </span> The engineer did not try to overcome the obstacle, and he was
                    wise.</i>
